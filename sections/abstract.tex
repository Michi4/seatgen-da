Seatgen is a internal tool for the company Solvistas. We cooperated with Solvistas to help them with their organization and management of their product, which sells tickets for sport-events which take place in stadiums. Seatgen allows the members of Solvistas to create and edit stadium plans in a fraction of the time that it used to take. With a selection of our handy tools, the workflow to create an entire seating plan gets very efficient and allows the people to create, move and edit seats, areas and more. The tool is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive so that the people at Solvistas don't have to spend a lot of time learning new software.
