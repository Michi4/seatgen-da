Seatgen is a internal tool for the company Solvistas. We cooperated with Solvistas to help them with their organization and management of their product, which sells tickets for sport-events which take place in stadiums. Seatgen allows the members of Solvistas to create and edit stadium plans in a fraction of the time that it used to take.
