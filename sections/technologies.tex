\section{Spring Boot and Kotlin}

For the backend logic, we had to use Spring Boot, because Spring boot is in the main Stack of Solvistas, and the project should later be maintainable by Solvistas developers. TODO: Mehr spring schreiben

As for the language we used Kotlin in Spring boot even though it's not used in many of Solvistas projects. We still decided that Kotlin was the better option because it is a modern language that is fully interoperable with Java and has many features that make it easier to write clean and concise code, thus reducing errors, improving readability and maintainability. It eliminates much of the boilerplate code required in Java and provides a rich standard library with many built-in utility functions, significantly reducing development time. Kotlin has no essential functionalities that java couldn't provide, but it is more modern and has a more concise syntax. TODO: Da a bissi mehr schreibi so kotlin vs java ka
