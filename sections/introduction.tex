\section{Initial Situation}
\setauthor{Michael Stenz}
The company Solvistas GmbH is a software development company, and one of their main products is the Ticketing project. Ticketing is a software solution that enables customers to purchase tickets for seats or sections in stadiums and other venues hosting events. The software is used by various sports clubs and event organizers to manage ticket sales for their events.


\section{Problem Statement}
\setauthor{Michael Stenz}
The as just mentioned stadiums and venues have a lot of seats and different areas, and therefore the Ticketing software needs to know the layout of the seats. These layouts can have lots of complex shapes like curves and other irregular shapes. The current process of creating these so-called seat plans is done manually by editing text files. There are many problems, and it's a very tedious process when editing seat plans within a text editor. To name a few: When changing the layout of a stadium, all the text files have to be reworked by a schooled developer. This costs the customer a lot of money, and the developer a lot of time. Also, it's very hard to imagine how the rendered plan looks, when staring at text files.

Uploading the plan image is another tedious task when creating new plans. To convert the given SVG file into a functional map compatible with their system, the developer must manually upscale and slice the SVG into tiles, repeating this process for each zoom levelâ€”typically 5 to 7 times. Additionally, since each tile is divided into four smaller tiles at every zoom level, the number of tiles increases exponentially. As a result, a massive number of files must be uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket, making the process even more time-consuming.

\section{Goal}
\setauthor{Michael Stenz}
The goal of the diploma thesis was to develop a custom solution for the company Solvistas and solve all these aforementioned problems with a tool that's intuitive to use and easy to learn, saving time and costs. We wanted to create a visual editor to create and manage seat plans for events in a stadium. This editor allows customers to create and edit new seating plans themselves, making the process so accessible and easy to use that no more schooled developers are required to make changes in a seating plan.
