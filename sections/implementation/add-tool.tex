The \textbf{Add-Tool} in SeatGen provides the ability to manually place individual seats on the stadium map. It is primarily used for precise editing and complements bulk placement features such as the Grid-Tool.

\textbf{Key Responsibilities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enables manual placement of seats at a specific position on the map.
    \item Internally dispatches an \texttt{AddSeatAction} to update global state.
    \item Supports undo and redo via the action system.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Triggering the Action}

A seat is created externally and passed to the \texttt{AddSeatAction} class, which is then executed via the \texttt{doAction} method from context.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TypeScript, caption=Calling AddSeatAction, label=lst:add-tool-action-call]
context.doAction(new AddSeatAction(newSeat, context.setSeats));
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Explanation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \texttt{newSeat} is constructed outside and passed to the action.
    \item The action handles the insertion of the seat into global state.
    \item This mechanism ensures consistent integration with undo and redo logic.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{AddSeatAction Implementation}

The actual seat insertion logic is encapsulated in the \texttt{AddSeatAction} class.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=TypeScript, caption=AddSeatAction Implementation, label=lst:add-seat-action]
export default class AddSeatAction extends Action {
    private readonly newSeat: Seat;
    private readonly setSeats: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<Seat[]>>;

    constructor(newSeat: Seat, setSeats: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<Seat[]>>) {
        super();
        this.newSeat = newSeat;
        this.setSeats = setSeats;
    }

    execute(): void {
        this.setSeats(prev => [...prev, this.newSeat]);
    }

    undo(): void {
        this.setSeats(prev => prev.filter(seat => seat.id !== this.newSeat.id));
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{How It Works:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{execute()} appends the new seat to the seat list.
    \item \texttt{undo()} removes it again by filtering the ID.
    \item This implementation ensures full undo and redo compatibility.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}
The \textbf{Add-Tool} provides a foundational editing feature in SeatGen, allowing users to place single seats precisely. It ties into the system's action-based architecture and contributes to a robust and reversible seat editing experience.
