When it comes to design patterns we chose a lot of different ones, in many sectors. Because we had lots of specific problems that we solved with the development of our own design patterns / derivations of existing ones. Because the interactive editor part and tool part has a lot of complex features, and lots of well known features like undoing actions. For this particular feature for example we searched for existing solutions, and there are lots of solutions out there, but we went with our own implementation in the end. We had a special design pattern for the following parts of the application:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Undo/Redo
\item Tool System
\item Backend services
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Undo/Redo}

The undo and redo feature is very important for usability of the application. This is a very important feature expected by the user, because it is a feature in almost every modern editor no matter text or visual.
