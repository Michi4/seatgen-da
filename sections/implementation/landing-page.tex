A landing page was created to give the entire application a more complete look, and instead of dropping the user directly into the application, information about the developers, the application, the technologies, and a visual demonstration in the form of a GIF that shows how a basic workflow with SeatGen could look like is provided. The landing page also has a similar color scheme to the application, but it is way more visually pleasing and filled with more animations and gradients, because SeatGen focuses more on the functionality and the speed of the workflow instead of animations that could distract the user from the work. The landing page is shown in Figure \ref{fig:landing-page}.
